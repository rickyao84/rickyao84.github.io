	<h1>The Timeline of Motherboards(Rick)<h1/>
			<h2>What were motherboards like in the past?<h2/>
					<h5>Back in the older days, building a PC from scratch was typically meant for engineers, who knew a lot about computers.
						They widely varied from manufacturer to manufacturer, and it was common to buy a pre-built PC.  Operating Systems were also designed to run on a specific motherboard.</h5>
      <h2>Watch the video below, to understand more about motherboard history.</h2>

      <h2>The Motherboard, Now</h2>
      <h5>The motherboard today is very standardized, having standardized connectors, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA" target="_blank">SATA connectors</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express" target="_blank">PCI-E connectors</a> as well as the I/O being very standardized, with USB-C ports, HDMI, as well as SD card readers as well as DisplayPort connectors being present on every motherboard.</h5>

<h2>Future Motherboard?</h2>
<h5>In the future, we can expect to see faster channel memory, and even more RAM slots, as well as more expansion slots. Motherboard manufacturers are always striving to achieve faster performance than the previous model, as well as blow away at their competition. Also, motherboard manufacturers are also trying to improve on their looks! At CES 2020, MicroStar International debuted an awesome Gold-Plated motherboard, built purely for gamers, who want to show off their new motherboards. Also, some motherboard makers are debuting dual-CPU designs, allowing 2 CPU's to be used in tandem, in order ot achieve lots of processing power.</h5>
