		<h1>Motherboard Basics(Michael)<h1/>
				<h2>What is a motherboard?<h2/>
						<h3>A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other computer systems.
							It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the CPU,
							memory, and GPU, and provides connectors for other peripherals that can be added on later. The motherboard is mainly
							used for processing, as it acts as a bridge to transfer data from one computer component at a time. </h3><br>
  <h5>Motherboards also tend to be manufactured by the same people, here are a list of the top motherboard manufactuers. </h5>
  <h2>Sizes of Motherboard<h2>
  <h3>There are 3 sizes of motherboard, listed from largest to smallest.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>ATX</li>
            <li>Mini ATX</li>
            <li>Micro ATX</li>
		</ul>

        <h3>Here, we can see the motherboard's basic structure. We have I/O related tasks, which have to deal with data(think binary), and we have memory related tasks, which are like your RAM, GPU, as well as hard drives. The NorthBridge deals with "memory" tasks, and the SouthBridge deals with your input and output devices, such as keyboards, mice, scanners, cameras, etc. Also, the SouthBridge deals with keeping the time on your computer with the CMOS battery, as well as preserving your boot settings on the BIOS chip.
        <h2>Problems With Motherboards</h2>
        <h3>Often, there are bottlenecks between the NorthBridge and the SouthBridge, as there is a limited amount of bandwidth in order to transmit data. Just like a highway, it can be either conjested or busy. When it is rush hour, the cars will all travel slower, and when it is off-peak hours, the cars can travel at a higher speed, as there are less people on the road. This is exactly what happens in a motherboard. When you are doing an intensive task, such as coding a game, or video editing, it actually isn't the CPU or GPU that is slow, but the amount of data packets that are being transported along the bus line have to wait to get to their destinations, which is the main problem that plagues high-performance motherboards.
